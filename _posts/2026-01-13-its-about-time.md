It's been a very long time since I had my own blog. In recent years, I've had the privilege of guest blogging for various outlets, including [The White House](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/breakthroughs-for-alldelivering-equitable-access-to-americas-research/), [The Good Science Project](https://goodscience.substack.com/p/reforming-the-nihs-intramural-program), [dataindex.us](https://dataindex.us/newsletter/article/6cfecae3-3c89-487e-b8f7-cfcd85ded6c7), and [Upstream](https://upstream.force11.org/author/marcum/) (among others). I'll continue to guest blog from time-to-time when a topic is appropriate for a specific venue. However, I can't always find a home for some of my perspectives and this blog will fill that void in my publishing portfolio. 

I have been wanting to start a blog for a long time but was entirely overwhelmed by hosting and platforming choices. However, I found the need strong enough to overcome my [choice paralysis](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/choice-overload-bias). After chatting about options with science-blogging guru [Martin Fenner](https://blog.front-matter.de/author/martin/) earlier today, I decided on keeping it simple and sticking with what I know. The result, a very thin Jekyll-based blog that has no bells or whistles what-so-ever. I chose the title, "Open Evidence" to reflect my general interest in evidence-based policymaking and advocacy for open science - but there will be lots of other topics as well. 

Okay, there is one bell and one whistle. This setup uses the `jekyll-feed` plugin, which is supported by GitHub Pages. This allows readers to follow updates without relying on centralized social media algorithms. It also allows the blog to be indexed by [The Rogue Scholar](https://rogue-scholar.org/). I also added a simple slugify-based approach to incorporate tags. This is mainly for my own organization purposes.
